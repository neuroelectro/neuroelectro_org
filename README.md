# NeuroElectro Database

## Notice: The NeuroElectro website is currently unavailable

The NeuroElectro database, which compiles and organizes electrophysiological data for neuron types, is temporarily inaccessible due to recent server updates, as of October 2024. These updates have rendered the hosting of the NeuroElectro website, developed using older frameworks such as Python 2.7, incompatible with the current system. Unfortunately, there is no clear timeline for when the website will be restored, but we are actively exploring solutions.

In the meantime, you can access a historical version of the NeuroElectro website via a snapshot of NeuroElectro through the Internet Wayback Machine: [View Archived Website](https://web.archive.org/web/20240901182905/https://neuroelectro.org/)

We appreciate your understanding and patience as we work through these challenges. For updates, please check back here periodically or contact the repository maintainers directly through the [Issues](https://github.com/neuroelectro/neuroelectro_org/issues) page.

Thank you,
